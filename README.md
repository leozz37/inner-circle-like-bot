# Inner Circle Like Bot

Inner Circle is a dating app, where you must "like" a person and vice versa so that you can chat!
Sometimes clicking like several times in a row can be a tiring task, so we created a bot to automate that task!

## Running

First you need an Inner Circle account (create one [here](https://theinnercircle.co/) if you don't have one) and
have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

Clone or download this repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/leozz37/inner-circle-like-bot
```
